Hello there! This is my first post, of probably exactly one post. In this blog I want to write about my motivation and reasons for what I code,
and what I learned along the way. If you're interested, stay tuned!

I might write about [projects](/projects) I've done in the past, but don't count on those ever being looked at by me or anyone else again.

If I'm bored, I might also write about random things I find interesting or want to share.

Enjoy your stay!
